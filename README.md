# Bird App Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build and Deployment

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/bird-app` directory. 

The server for the client build is available at https://github.com/alasz1/bird-server. The Build has now been placed in the `public` directory of the server repository, which has been connected via automatic pipeline to Heroku.

The API URL of the client can be found in bird.service.ts - if server is deployed to another location, the URL should be updated here.

The live app can be visited at https://bird-app-1.herokuapp.com.
